# Flamingo
## Introduction
### Your Online Travel Agent
Flamingo is an online travel agent app that focuses on travel customization without the need to converse with a human agent. As of now, Expedia and TripMaster offer competitive prices for travel, lodging, and activities. The problem is that they either sell whole pre-made packages or individual components of travel. In the latter case, it is completely up to the user to try look for what they want (often by searching numerous times). The goal is to minimize this effort by taking the user through a travel building process. Flamingo prompts users for destination, travel date, and various other travel constraints (e.g. budget) then suggests transportation options, lodging options, and even activities in one continuous flow.
